Choosing random names from Random_isimler.txt file, random age, tc number, phone number and IMEI
It is requested to write a program that generates the number. Do not use the random ready function in this program.
We have been asked to design our own random library. Writing in the C language
Since there is no class structure in C language, we created the project by likening the struct structure to the class structure.
We generated the information of the random person requested from us via the random function. Personal tc, mourning, phone
We used inheritance to generate number and imei.
